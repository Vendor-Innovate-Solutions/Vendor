- ✅ **Companies** - Full CRUD operations with ICP backend
- ✅ **Categories** - Complete category management via ICP services
- ✅ **Products** - Advanced product management with image handling
- ✅ **Stock Count** - Complex inventory tracking with product creation
- ✅ **Create Bill** - Advanced invoice creation with multi-step forms

### ICP Service Layer (Complete)
- ✅ **Authentication Service** - Internet Identity integration
- ✅ **Company Service** - Full company management CRUD
- ✅ **Category Service** - Category operations with hierarchy support
- ✅ **Product Service** - Advanced product management with variants
- ✅ **Stock Service** - Inventory tracking and product creation
- ✅ **Invoice Service** - Complex invoice creation and management
- ✅ **Accounting Service** - Financial data management

### Deployment Infrastructure (Complete)
- ✅ **Unified DFX Configuration** - Single dfx.json for both frontend/backend
- ✅ **Next.js ICP Configuration** - Static export optimized for ICP
- ✅ **Automated Deployment Scripts** - Local and mainnet deployment
- ✅ **Development Environment Setup** - One-command development startup
- ✅ **Environment Variable Management** - Auto-configuration based on network

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Validate setup
./validate.sh

# Start local development
./dev-setup.sh

# Deploy to local testnet
./deploy.sh local

# Deploy to IC mainnet
./deploy.sh ic
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   cd frontend && npm ci && cd ..
   
   # Verify configuration
   ./validate.sh
   ```

2. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Start DFX and deploy locally
   ./dev-setup.sh
   
   # Frontend will be available at:
   # http://localhost:4943/?canisterId=<asset_canister_id>
   ```

3. **Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to Internet Computer
   ./deploy.sh ic
   
   # Your app will be available at:
   # https://<canister_id>.icp0.io
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Details
